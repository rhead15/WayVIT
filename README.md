# WayVIT
WayVIT is a promising solution to address common issues faced by VITians by integrating an RFID Card scanning system and an in-built wallet. This app scans the RFID Card while they enter the shuttle and automatically deducts the amount from the wallet in the app. 

Some features of WayVIT:

Streamlined Payments: Eliminates the need for cash and entering  the UPI Pin, reducing transaction time.

Convenience: Automates the payment process, ensuring consistent and hassle-free payments.

Transparency: Provides a clear record of shuttle usage and payments.

Feedback Loop: Encourages user feedback to improve the app and service over time.
